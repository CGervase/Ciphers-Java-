This is a tool written in Java that encrypts or decrypts text using one of four ciphers: [caesar] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), 
[atbash] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash), [affine] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher), and [vigen√®re] 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher). A demo of this program can be found [here] (https://repl.it/EvKB/10).
